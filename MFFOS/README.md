# MUTANT FELINE FROM OUTER SPACE

## This is a simple Javascript/HTML game about a _mutant feline from outer space_.

## Getting Started
The only thing you need to play the game is to load the index.html from the main folder

##H ow to Play the Game
The objective of this game is to keep the poptart cat alive for the longest possible amount of time, and doing so, increasing your total score.
The base score is directly dependent on the ellapsed time, and every asteroid the cat destroys will add 150 points to your total score.
At the bottom of the screen the HUD will display the amount of **lives** first, then the amount of **roars** and finally the highest score (local).
The game is over if your life count reaches 0. You are able to destroy the nearby comets with the cat's roar by using the left-click button on your mouse.
Right-click is disabled on canvas.
Right after losing a life, the cat will have one second of immunity in which no damage will be inflicted.
You lose a life by colliding against asteroids or touching the edges of the canvas.
There are bonuses. The orange colored cupcake will add one life to your life count, the blue cupcake will add a roar to the roar count.
An asteroid will be spawned every second. Bonuses spawn every three seconds.

### The raw unadultered extremely hard mode
_The Mutant Feline From Outer Space_ has been written on top of the base code of the _raw unadultered extremely hard mode_. You can switch to that mode by clicking the link at the bottom of the page.
The goal is to keep to red square from touching anything and the game will end whenever collision is detected, be it against the black blocks, or the borders of the canvas.
A link at the bottom will take you back to the _Mutant Feline From Outer Space_ game.

## Optimal Setup
The canvas in which the game runs has dimentions of 800x800 pixels. Depending on the current resolution, it is necessary to **zoom out** your page so you are able to enjoy the game in its entirety.

## The Code
The code for this game has been written in its most part in Javascript with the aid of the brilliantly wonderful VSCode. HTML and CSS were minimally used.
Due to time constraints, the refactoring of the code hasn't been done as of this moment. It should run slightly smoother after a bit of work.
